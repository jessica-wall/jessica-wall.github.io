									Spam vs Ham
								</h>
								
								<P>
									&emsp; For this project the problem was simple. There is a directory of email files and the program needs to deciper whethere the emial is spam or ham. To do this multiple directories were given to train an algorithm that will be used to judge other files. To do this, my partner and I used hashmaps to map each induvidual word with a percentage of it appearing in spam and ham. This was done with java and using java FXML for the UI. Since we were given what correct answer of the test directory we were also able to test the accuracy of our algorithm as shown.

									Minesweepers
								</h>
								<P>
									&emsp; This is a group recreations of the game Minesweepers. Although playing the game itself follows the original rules, we added a server base that could accept multiple clients. This way a scoreboard can be shown with the top 10 scores. The game allows three modes; easy, medium, and hard. The score is based off how many moves are taken and if the player can sucessfully complete the board. Java was used for the code and java FXML was used for the UI.

									File Sharing
								</h>
								<P>
									&emsp; This is a partership to create a server that would be able to file share .txt files. The user would be able to pick a directory from their file system to open in the program. They would then be able to upload and download the files to and from the server. The point of this project was to really focus on the sever to client communication. Java was used to code and java FXML was used for the UI.

						Text Based Battles
					</h>
					<P>
						&emsp; This text based program is a Pokemon inspired battle situation that allowed the user to input a number that was associated with a command. Some of the commands possible were attack, switch character, heal, and leave attack. These options would often lead to another menu avaliable to the user. This program relied heavily on object oriented programming as well as functions.

						Tower of Hanoi
					</h>
					<P>
						&emsp; In this program I used a recursive function to solve any size Tower of Hanio. The bases of the puzzle is simple, you must move the tower of rings stacked largest to smallest to a third peg keeping it from largest to smallest. The catch is you cannot stack a larger ring on top of a smaller ring.

						Blackjack

					<P>
						&emsp; C was one of the first languages I learned as a programmer. I Visual Basic to code a drag and drop UI. This program was to help me apply concepts like arrays and functions. The user would play against the computer by using buttons to hit, stay, and bet.
					</p>
					<H>
						Pointers
					</h>
					<P>
						&emsp; C++ was the first language that was introduced to me at the university level. I started off learning syntax and moved to concepts like 2D arrays and classes. The final step in learning was to utalize pointers and how they are useful. I learned the difference of calling by reference vs calling the pointer.
