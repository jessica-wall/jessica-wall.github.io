						Let's Get Personal

					<P>
						&emsp; I grew up in a small town called Walsingham that is located in the southwest of Ontario, right off of Lake Erie. My parents had both migrated from Chihuahua, Mexico with their families to grow up in Canada. Our native language is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plautdietsch_language">Plautdietsch</a> and we come from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plautdietsch_language">Mennonite Denomination</a>.

						&emsp; Over my years of learning I have had the oppertunity to observe and gain many different skills. When it comes to tech I have had hand on expirence with Java, C, C++, Python, HTML, CSS. In addition to this I have been able to see how other programming languages work like PHP and CX-Programmer. I have used this knowledge to work through many projects, some of which you can see under my portfolio. I have also been able to really expand my business social platforms. I can use Google Meets, Adobe Connect, Microsoft Teams, Skype, and Zoom. When it comes to hardware I like to play around with mini computers. Particularly arduinos. I am also currently looking into the hardware of a computer, specifically building and repairing PCs and laptops.
						<br/>
						&emsp; To speak more of my soft skills, I am an innovative problem-solver that generates workable solutions around complex challenges. Tech based and other.
						I have strong communication skills. I am not afraid to send an email to clarify details. I am resourceful. I know how and where to look if I do not understand concepts.
						I excel at building trusting relationships with all. I love to work with others as well as by myself. I am dependable and hard-working. I am committed to achieving excellence with an upbeat, positive attitude. No one likes a downer. And I am highly motivated. I love to see a project through and finished.

						&emsp; As a part of my journey to persue a degree in computer science I have been taking the oppertunity to participate in cooperative learning. So far, I have completed one full work term in an IT position at Toyotetsu CA located in Simcoe Ontario. In this project, I was not just a teir one IT clerk, but apart of integrating an inventory tracking system, PLEX, to an already stable running enviroment.
						This job was great at showing my how a large scale project is integrated from all sides. Not only was I responsible for the installation and set up of all (approx 200) network printers, I was able to participate in the trial and live event for each area. This allowed me to see how all departments contibuted and what they were responsible for as well as how they troubleshoot any issues.
						Along with this I was also able to see the basic teir one IT tasks including phone resets, computer imaging, and device troubleshooting.
